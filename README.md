A tft match scraper, inspired from github.com/fattorib/LeagueMatchScraper.

created in a learning process, i've tested the accuracy, scored 20 % in test data

but it doesn't get really far from the answer theoretically, so if we used it aiming at 1st place, worst case is getting 3rd or 4th, which is positive reanked wise in tft

you can find what i extracted in https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaachehboune/tft-advisor.
